**Installation:**

For Windows: *** Installation for Windows is quite easy ***

      1.    Download Mod ( it would be an .zip package - you need 7zip or winrar to decompress it or just use windows-owned archive manager )
      2.    Open "server-init.cfg" and setup all required lines like your wishes
      3.    Close and save "server-init.cfg" file
      4.    Then start "GoldMod.exe" or "GoldMod.bat" 
      4.1   Just look at the taskbar near by the digital clock down right corner, there's an sauerbraten-similar icon, right click to it, click to "Open Console" to show server console or "Exit" for shutdown server
      4.1.1 If you use GoldMod.bat you need to close opened console and server console too, otherwise it will keep running
      5.    Server is running now. Connect to "log/" directory to show server log ( serverlog.gmsl )
      6.    Congratulations! You successfully set up your own server. ;D Have fun

      PS: To edit CubeScript Part of mod to to "scripts/" directory
      PPS: To edit source code, open "GoldMod.cbp" ( you need Code::Blocks )
      PPPS: Thanks to degrave for helping me with source ;)
      PPPPS: For linux and mac installation just follow remod instuctions, they are same
